Created a Java program that emulates the classic Pong game. Credits go to Bro Code as most code was sourced from their YouTube channel. Two players control their "paddles" to bounce the ball off of, and the ball's velocity increases after each bounce. If a player fails to catch a rebound, the opposing player earns a point. The point system is infinite by design and the game can only be ended manually.
